# Secret key
# ~~~~~
# The secret key is used to secure cryptographics functions.

# See http://www.playframework.com/documentation/latest/ApplicationSecret for more details.

# Router
# ~~~~~
# Define the Router object to use for this application.
# This router will be looked up first when the application is starting up,
# so make sure this is the entry point.
# Furthermore, it's assumed your route file is named properly.
# So for an application router like `my.application.Router`,
# you may need to define a router file `conf/my.application.routes`.
# Default to Routes in the root package (and conf/routes)

# Database configuration
# ~~~~~
# You can declare as many datasources as you want.
# By convention, the default datasource is named `default`

# db.default.driver=org.h2.Driver

# db.default.password=""

# Evolutions

# You can disable evolutions if needed
